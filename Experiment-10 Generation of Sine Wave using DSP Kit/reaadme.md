## THEORY
Sinusoidal are the most smooth signals with no abrupt variation in their amplitude, the amplitude witnesses gradual change with time. Sinusoidal signals can be defined as a periodic signal with waveform as that of a sine wave. The amplitude of sine wave increase from a value of 0 at 0° angle to a maximum value of 1 at 90° , it further reaches its minimum value of -1 at 270° and then return to 0 at 360° . After any angle greater than 360° , the sinusoidal signal repeats the values so we can say that time period of sinusoidal signal is 2π i.e. 360°.If we observe the graph, we can see that the amplitude varying gradually with a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. We can also observe that the wave begins to repeat its value after a time period or angle value of 2π hence periodicity of sinusoidal signal is 2π.
These are sinusoidal signal parameters:

- Graph: It is a plot used to depict the relation between quantities. Depending upon the number of variables, we can decide to number of axes each perpendicular to the other.

-  Time period: The period for a signal can be defined as the time taken by a periodic signal to complete one cycle.

-  Amplitude: Amplitude can be defined as the maximum distance between the horizontal axis and the vertical position of any signal.

-  Frequency: This can be defined as the number of times a signal oscillates in one second. It can be mathematically defined as the reciprocal of a period.

-  Phase: It can be defined as the horizontal position of a waveform in one oscillation. The symbol θ is used to indicate the phase.
  If we consider a sinusoidal signal y(t) having an amplitude A, frequency f, and phase of quantity then we can represent the signal as

                          ` 𝑦(𝑡)=𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝜋𝑓𝑡+ 𝜃)`

 If we denote 2πf as an angular frequency ω the we can re-write the signal as
 
                         `𝑦(𝑡)=𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔𝑡+ 𝜃 )`
