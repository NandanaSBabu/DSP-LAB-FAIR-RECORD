The Overlap-Add method, on the other hand, handles circular convolution by adding overlapping sections of the convolved blocks. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Block Decomposition: The input signal is split into non-overlapping blocks of size. Each block is then zero-padded to a size of , where  is the length of the filter.

2. FFT and Convolution: Each block is convolved with the filter using FFT. Since the blocks are zero-padded, the convolution produces valid linear results, but the output blocks overlap.

3. Overlap and Add: After convolution, the results of each block overlap by samples. These overlapping regions are added together to form the final output.
