## THEORY
Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce a third signal. It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory. 

Mathematical Definition:

Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as: 

`y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭−𝛕) 𝐝𝛕∞−∞` 

Applications: 

•	Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies or noise. 

•	System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its behaviour, and convolution can be used to determine the output of the system given a known input. 

•	Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, and sharpening images.
